/**
 *  The WHY of this hook:
 * 
 * Unfortunately, upgrading to @react-navigation v6 introduces a bug in the function `replace` 
 * that was not present in previous versions. This bug affects only iOS and appears when replacing
 * a modal screen with another modal screen, causing the app to crash.
 * 
 * To the date of this writing, the issue has been reported several times on react-navigation repository,
 * but with little to none response from the maintainers as it seems to scalate to react-native itself, 
 * because of that we have to come up with our own workaround as none of the known workarounds worked for us ðŸ¥².
 * 
 * The WHAT of this hook:
 * 
 * To achive similar functionality to the `replace` function, we are using the `reset` and `pop` functions
 * to manually modify the navigation stack. Please only use this hook when the original `replace` function
 * causes the crash mentioned above.
 *
